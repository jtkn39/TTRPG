# Welcome to the character generator

I wrote this to help me come up with NPCs to populate my D&D campaign settings

I'd like to cheerfully credit the following sources:
 - Ancestries are taken mainly from the D&D 5th edition players handbook.
 - Vices, virtues, drawbacks and disorders are taken from Zweihander core rules.
 - Companions and retainers are taken from MCDM's Flee, Mortals book.
 
 
### Using the roster
 - Each time you find a character you like, you can add them to the **roster**.
 - Make sure the *add character to roster* option is checked, then click *Next*.
 - You can view the characters in your roster by using the dropdown tab
     - Here you can save your characters in a csv format
     - You can also delete the entire roster
